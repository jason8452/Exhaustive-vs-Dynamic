How to run:
- Run it either through running the proj2.exe or through the proj2.py itself.
- When running, however, change the directory location of the file in the code to match where it is on your system. (line 44)
- Make sure to have all files in one place
- Then erase the output (keep the beginning segment)
- Then when you debug the file, it should say for you to overwrite (on VSC) click overwrite and then check output.txt

There were a few issues with trying to read the samples from the input.txt directly and so manually inputted all 10 samples.
